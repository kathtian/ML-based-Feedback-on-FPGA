# ML-based-Feedback-on-FPGA
Use FPGA-based machine learning inference in feedback control to stabilize laser beam and to cancel high frequency noises. This is work to apply machine learning to solve a typical engineering feedback control problem.

# 1. Problem: 
Stabilizing a laser light beam is a common challenge. This stabilization of light, whether it's a laser, X-ray, electron beam or any other type of light, presents a typical feedback problem encountered in engineering. It's crucial for X-ray synchronization experiments, biomedical imaging, and nanofabrication processes in extreme ultraviolet (EUV), deep ultraviolet (DUV), and electron beam lithography. For many cases, traditional feedback theories like Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller feedback have successfully addressed this problem.

However, in the case of nonlinear problems, there is no widely accepted standard feedback approach. This work aims to leverage machine learning for feedback control to tackle nonlinear behaviors.
